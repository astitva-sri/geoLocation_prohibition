# Geolocation Prohibition Device

## Overview

The Geolocation Prohibition Device is a compact and lightweight GPS tracker designed for attaching to animals or individuals. This device transmits its location to a central server, allowing authorized users such as farmers or prison authorities to monitor and track the movement of livestock or prisoners. In case of any escape attempts, timely intervention becomes possible.

## Key Benefits

- **Prevention**: Effectively prevents livestock or prisoner escapes.
- **Tracking**: Real-time tracking of the movement of livestock and prisoners.
- **Cost-Effective**: A cost-effective alternative to hiring security guards or installing physical barriers.

## Introduction

The necessity for geolocation prohibition devices arises from the growing need to monitor and control movements within specific geographical areas. Traditional methods of physical surveillance can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to human error. Geolocation prohibition devices provide a more efficient and reliable alternative by leveraging the power of geolocation technology.

While other alternatives exist to address this issue, they often fall short in terms of effectiveness and convenience. Physical barriers, such as fences or walls, can be costly to install and maintain, and they may be breached or damaged. Human guards or personnel can be employed, but their capacity to cover vast areas is limited and they may be susceptible to fatigue or distractions.

## Features

- **Real-Time Alerts**: Geolocation prohibition devices offer instant notifications when unauthorized exits or entries occur within defined boundaries.
- **Livestock Management**: Ideal for farmers and ranchers to create virtual boundaries around grazing areas, ensuring the safety and containment of their livestock.
- **Correctional Facilities**: In correctional facilities, these devices are invaluable for monitoring prisoners, helping detect and respond to escape attempts.

## Conclusion

Geolocation prohibition devices provide a cutting-edge solution to address the need for efficient location-based monitoring and control. Whether it's keeping track of livestock or preventing prisoner escapes, these devices offer unparalleled usability, making them an invaluable asset in various industries and settings.
